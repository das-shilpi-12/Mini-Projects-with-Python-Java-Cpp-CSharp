C++ is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used nowadays for competitive programming. 
It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). 
The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. 
*******************************************************************************************************************
# Features #

> Simple: 
It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.
> Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:
A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.
> Mid-level language: 
It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)
> Rich library support: 
Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.
> Speed of execution: 
C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.
> Pointer and direct Memory-Access: 
C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).
> Object-Oriented: 
One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.
> Compiled Language: C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.
********************************************************************************************************************
# Applications of C++ #

> Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)
> Browsers (Chrome & Firefox)
> Graphics & Game engines (Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)
> Database Engines (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)
> Cloud/Distributed Systems

I will create various mini projects with C++ language. 
Thank you.
